# Combustion-Partial_Stirred_Reactor
The PaSR model is a simplified reactor representation that allows partial mixing of reactantsâ€”more realistic than a perfectly stirred reactor but computationally lighter than full CFD. In this project, simulations explore how mixing time and chemical time scales affect combustion efficiency, pollutant formation, and flame stability.
