# Combustion-Partial_Stirred_Reactor
The PaSR model is a simplified reactor representation that allows partial mixing of reactants—more realistic than a perfectly stirred reactor but computationally lighter than full CFD. In this project, simulations explore how mixing time and chemical time scales affect combustion efficiency, pollutant formation, and flame stability. 

# ⚗️ Partial Stirred Reactor (PaSR) Simulation

This project simulates combustion in a Partial Stirred Reactor (PaSR), which models systems with partial mixing of reactants — a practical compromise between PSR and full CFD.

## Objectives
- Simulate partial mixing in combustion.
- Analyze residence time and mixing effects on reaction rates.
- Evaluate pollutant formation and efficiency.

## Key Concepts
- PaSR modeling approach
- Chemical time vs. mixing time
- Mean reaction rate estimation

## Tools Used
- Custom OpenFOAM implementation or tabulated chemistry
- Python for parametric study

## Outcomes
- Parametric results of varying mixing intensities
- Practical understanding of PaSR utility in combustion design
